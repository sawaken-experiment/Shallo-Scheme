Shallo-Scheme
==============
Shallo-Scheme is my own implementation of Scheme language.

Many essential elements of Scheme language are implemented.

(But, this implementation does NOT meet any official Scheme SPEC such as R5RS, R6RS. So, Shallo-Scheme is not Scheme exactly.)


### Features ###
    Continuation (call/cc)
    Macro (not hygienic)
    Tail Call Optimization
    Exception System
    Garbage Collector

### Usage ###
    $ cd src
    $ make
    $ ./scheme [source file]


What is shallow?
----------------
Of course my knowledge and technique of language-implementation and C-language-programming are.
This is my first time of implementing programming-language-interpreter, so I have done almost all things by feel (my own way).

Destination
-----------
This was developed completely for my learning.
I feel like updating (or remaking) and documenting this in the future when having time.
