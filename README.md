shallow-scheme
==============
shallow-scheme is my own implementation of Scheme language.

Many essential elements of Scheme language are implemented.
For example, 
  : Continuation (call/cc)
  : Macro (not hygienic)
  : Tail Call Optimization
  : Exception System
  : Garbage Collector

(But, this implementation does NOT meet any official Scheme SPEC such as R5RS, R6RS. So, shallow-scheme is not Scheme exactly.)


What is shallow?
----------------
Of course my knowledge and technique of language-implementation...
This is my first time of implementing programming-language-interpreter, so I have done almost all things by feel.

Destination
-----------
This was developed completely for my learning.
I want update (or remake) this in the future when having time.
